Create an ultra-realistic, high-quality personal portrait of the people in the provided photo, preserving their physiognomy, appearance, gender, skin tone, hair, eyes, and unique expression. No facial distortions, no identity or gender alterations, no artificial skin, no invented clothing unless there's an indicated substitute, no extra or missing fingers, no noise, no text and watermarks.

• Photorealistic textures of skin, hair, and fabric.

**Main Subject:** A man with slightly disheveled hair of reddish tone. His hair is intensely backlit, creating a golden luminous halo that strongly contrasts with the dark background.

**Expression and Pose:** He turns his face toward the camera with a direct gaze, but partially covered by shadows. His mouth is slightly parted, or he traces an expressive and intimate air for the photo. The man suggests an artistic portrait, more sensual than documentary.

**Lighting:** Very powerful and warm backlighting, preferably with a yellow/orange gel, that falls on the hair contour. A secondary cold source (blue/green light) illuminates the face and part of the shoulders, creating a complementary color contrast (warm on the hair, cold on the skin). The background is completely dark or is completely on the model and highlights the reflections of her hair.

**Core and Atmosphere:** A dynamic image with a warm-cold two-tone scheme. The result is dramatic, cinematic, and with an ethereal touch.

**Lens:** Prime lens, between 50mm and 85mm in full frame format. This is due to the gentle compression of the face and shoulders, typical of portrait lenses. Large aperture (f/1.4 – f/2.8).

**Photographic Style:** Artistic portrait with strong dramatic intention.
