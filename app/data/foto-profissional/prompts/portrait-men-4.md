Use the exact facial structure, bone anatomy, beard texture, gaze intensity, and hairline from the provided portrait reference. The identity must be absolute â€” no stylization, no reinterpretation, no softening of features.

Create a vertical hyper-realistic portrait of a man wearing an elegantly tailored black suit with a crisp white shirt and satin tie. He is adjusting his shirt cuff with one hand while slightly raising his other wrist to subtly display a luxury chronograph wristwatch.

**Lighting Requirements:**
- Strong, directional lighting creating dramatic split lighting (chiaroscuro effect)
- Half-shadow technique across his face and suit
- Deep shadows with brilliant contrast
- Completely dark gray background allowing only the illuminated side of the face and upper body to emerge

**Expression & Mood:**
- Powerful and serious expression
- Emphasis on confidence and control
- Commanding presence

**Technical Specifications:**
- High-end studio setup simulation
- Hasselblad 100MP fidelity
- Perfect lens sharpness
- Natural skin grain texture
- Premium fashion textile quality
- Cinematic shadows
- Subtle highlight gleam on the tie
- Selective depth of field on the wrist and pocket square

**Final Output:**
A studio-quality portrait that captures luxury, sophistication, and masculine authority through masterful use of light, shadow, and impeccable attention to detail.
