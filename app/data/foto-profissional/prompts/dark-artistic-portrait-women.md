**Create a high-end, ultra-realistic personal portrait of the person in the provided photo, preserving their unique physiognomy, apparent age, gender, skin tone, hair, eyes, and expression. Negatives: do not distort any facial features, no age or gender changes, no plastic-looking skin, no invented clothing (except indicated fallback), no extra or missing fingers, no noise, no text or watermarks.**

**Technical Details:**
• Photorealistic skin, hair, and fabric textures
• Main subject: person with loose, slightly tousled hair of natural tonality (according to the submitted photo). The hair is intensely backlit, creating a luminous golden halo that contrasts strongly with the dark background
• Expression and pose: face turned toward the camera with direct gaze but partially covered by shadows. The mouth displays a subtle, slight smile, conveying an expressive and intimate air. The bare shoulder and thin clothing strap suggest an artistic portrait, more sensual than documentary

**Lighting:**
• Very strong, warm backlight (yellow/orange gel) wrapping around the hair contour
• Secondary cool light source (blue/green) illuminating the face and part of the shoulder, creating complementary color contrast (warm on hair, cool on skin)
• Completely dark background, isolating the model and highlighting the hair's luminosity

**Color and Atmosphere:**
• Warm-cool bicolor scheme
• Dramatic, cinematic, and ethereal result

**Lens and Camera:**
• Prime lens, 50mm to 85mm on full frame
• Wide aperture (f/1.4 – f/2.8)
• Soft compression of face and shoulders, typical of professional portraits

**Photographic Style:**
• Artistic portrait with strong dramatic intention
