Redraw my photo, the new photograph with two figures against a simple white curtain backdrop.

FOREGROUND FIGURE (Me):
- Position: Center frame, facing camera directly
- Expression: Shocked with wide eyes and open mouth
- Hand gesture: Both hands raised to shoulder/head level making rock-and-roll horn signs (index and pinky fingers extended, thumb holding down middle and ring fingers)
- Outfit: Black tank top

BACKGROUND FIGURE - Ghostface character:
- Mask: White ghost mask with elongated drooping mouth and hollow black eyes
- Costume: Black robe
- Position: Standing directly behind me
- Action: One hand playfully placed on my neck
- Pose: Leaning forward, creating an eerie yet humorous interaction

PHOTO STYLE:
- Focus: Slight blur effect throughout the image
- Lighting: Even, flat lighting as if from a flash in a dark room, evenly distributed across the frame
- Atmosphere: Eerie yet humorous, like a casual photo-op
- Style: Natural, candid photo aesthetic without obvious staging

IMPORTANT: Do not retouch the face.
