Create a photo of me in a dreamy Y2K style standing in a 70s kitchen decorated with vintage Halloween decor. A retro TV in the back shows Pet Sematary as I hold a 90s orange corded phone, daydreaming, long loose curls with gold clips. I wear dainty gold necklaces, rings, and accessories. The dark wood, avocado green, and orange kitchen has 1980s Halloween decorations. On the counter: newspaper, carving tools, pumpkin guts, and two spooky jack-oâ€™-lanterns. My makeup is soft glam with brown lip liner and gloss. The photo feels grainy and dimly lit by a lamp at night. A bowl of popcorn sits nearby. Behind me in the dark hallway, Ghostface stands in the doorway, dimly lit, watching. Do not change my face or features.
