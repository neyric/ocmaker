Create a photo of me in a dreamy y2k style standing on a path in the woods with cabins in the far back in a thoughtful daydreaming pose her medium length dark brown hair dangling down, her skin tone slightly bronzed. She wears delicate jewelry including dainty gold necklaces and accessories and gold chunky rings. She’s wearing red 70’s style gym short shorts with white edging, and a white camp crystal lake camp counselor sweatshirt that is 70’s style ringer tee with red accents. She has white knee highs socks with two red bands at the top and is wearing a pair of black and white converse sneakers. Her makeup is simple yet glamorous with red lipgloss and red lipliner. The photo should have a grainy 70’s style to it. There should be fallen leaves around like a crisp fall day in colors of gold browns and red. A Friday the 13th style hockey masked his body should be dimly lit, and he should be standing behind a tree peaking around the side, the background behind her shoulder be slightly dark and ominous. Do not change my facial features, do not change my face.
